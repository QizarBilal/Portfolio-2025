## Project Overview
This is a visually striking, award-winning portfolio website for Mohammed Qizar Bilal, an AI-powered developer. The portfolio should feel alive, dynamic, and showcase futuristic development skills.

## Key Design Principles

- **Animation-First**: Every interaction should be smooth and delightful
- **Unique Layouts**: No standard timelines or card lists - every section is custom
- **AI-Infused Design**: Modern, intelligent, and forward-thinking aesthetics
